                        <p>There is a correlation between latitude and temperature. As one approaches the equator, which is represented by 0 Degrees Latitude,
                        the temperature becomes significantly warmer. However, the weather peaks at -20 Degrees Latitude, rather than at 0 Degrees Latitude, 
                        which may be due to obliquity, which is the angle of tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation.</p>
